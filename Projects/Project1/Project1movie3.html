    <p>When I first saw this movie, I did not like it at all. My reasoning was that it did not continue the story line form the two previous movies.  It was a whole new cast with a story of its own. As I grew older and later on saw it again, I started to appreciate what it brought to the movie scene and car scene. The idea of drifting was popularized and the customization of cars was valued and shown throughout the film. I will never forget bow wow showing off his green minivan and being proud, that scene sticks in my head.   </p>
