    <p>One of my all-time favorite movies, I can watch this anytime, anywhere and I will finish it. My favorite scene is in the beginning of the film. The panning of the camera from the back to focus on the bank robber overlooking his target was just a great sight to be seen. The addition of his mask by his duffle bag made it an unforgettable scene for me.  </p>
